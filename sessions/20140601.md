## Notes

### [Open Source Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)
Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made
available and licensed with a license in which the copyright holder provides the
rights to *study*, *change* and *distribute* the software to anyone and for any
purpose. Given the rich history that the Bay Area has with the OSS movement, it
is only fitting that we explore these concepts in depth. There are many facets
to the Open Source community and movement. Find more information about OSS:

  * [Free Software Foundation](http://fsf.org/)
  * [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/)

OSS == hacking. We will generally not be learning about [products](http://www.visualstudio.com/).
Instead we will focus on OSS and related communities.

### [Hipchat](https://hipchat.com/)
Hipchat is a team communication and collaboration tool. Hipchat has allows us
to create chat rooms that are [persistent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science))
and therefore searchable. It allows us to share links, files and discuss them.
Since it is [persistent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science))
we will be able to ask one another questions and answer them in an
[asynchronous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_learning) fashion.
Hipchat was created by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com), a for profit
company with a proven history of commitment to the open source community. [They
were recently valuated at $3.5B proving that committing to OSS does not mean you
will not make money!](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexmorrell/2014/04/09/new-financing-round-for-australian-software-company-atlassian-turns-founders-into-billionaires/)

### [Atom](https://atom.io)
Atom is an Integrated Development Environment or Editor. Atom or some editor is
the primary tool of any developer. We discussed general use of Atom and how it
is similar to Visual Studio Express (since a few of the guys know a little
something of VSE). Atom was created by the Github team and was recently open
sourced. It is written in CoffeeScript and is very easy to extend and modify.
We will be hacking on Atom to better hack in Atom (say that fast 10 times).

### [Github](https://github.com/)
Github is a social coding platform used by many professional software engineers
today. It allows multiple developers to work on the same code at the same time.
This is accomplished by keeping track of each change made to the code base.
Github is where our code will live. We will be hacking Github constantly. Github
loves to be hacked! More Github joy:

 * [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
 * [Github Help](https://help.github.com/)

### [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you
to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it
to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). Markdown makes it easy to create rich web
documents without allot of syntax.

## Homehacks

 1. Explore - Read and explore the documentation found at the links within this doc
 1. Hack    - Figure out how to install and use the Atom [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) plugin package. ([hint](http://joshbranchaud.com/blog/2014/02/27/Installing-Packages-In-Atom-Editor.html))
 1. Hack    - Personalize your Github and Hipchat Icons (lets not all use Phoenix pix :) )
